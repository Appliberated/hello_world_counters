**Hello World Counters** is a simple and discreet tally counter app for Android and the Web (PWA), built as one of my first "Hello World" projects in Flutter.

The app provides several distinct counters, each corresponding to a basic English color term (Red, Green, Blue, etc.). This design allows you to track multiple items simultaneously and discreetlyâ€”without anyone needing to know what you're counting.

### Features

- **Discreet, Color-Coded Counters:** Keep track of multiple tallies at once.
- **Simple Controls:** Easily increment, decrement, and reset each counter.
- **Share Functionality:** Share your counts via email, messengers, or social media.

### About this project

Hello World Counters is one of my first Hello World apps made with Flutter. 

[Hello World programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) are pretty famous, even if all they do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform, starting with such a simple program has become a tradition.

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) is an open source framework for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

## Contributing

Thank you for contributing! Hello World Counters is designed to be as simple and useless as possible, but you can still help with:

* testing and reporting bugs
* creating a nice icon to replace the [current one](web/icons/Icon-512.png)
