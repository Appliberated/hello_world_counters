# Hello World Counters

**Easy counting. Multiple color counters. An open source, Hello World Flutter app.**

[Hello World Counters](https://hellogramming.com/helloworldcounters/) is an easy to use tally counter app. It gives you a different counter for each of the unambiguous color terms in English: Black, White, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Brown, Purple, Pink, Orange, and Grey. This means you can count people, sheep, kisses, or smiles, and nobody will know what you are counting!

You can increment or decrement the counter, reset its value back to zero, or share it by email, messengers, or in social networks.

What else could you count with this app?

## Hello World

I'm learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and this is my first Hello World Flutter app.

Hello World apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform, starting with such a simple program has become a tradition.

Flutter is a UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
