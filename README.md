# Hello World Counters

Hello World Counters is an easy to use tally counter app for Android. It gives you a different counter for each of the unambiguous color terms in English: White, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Brown, Purple, Pink, Orange, and Grey. This means you can count people, sheep, kisses, or smiles, and nobody will know what you are counting!

You can increment or decrement the counter, reset its value back to zero, or share it by email, messengers, or in social networks.

What else could you count with this app? Let me know in the reviews!

## Hello World

I'm learning Flutter, and this is my first Hello World Flutter app.

Hello World apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform, starting with such a simple program has become a tradition.

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Open Source

Hello World Counters is free and open source, without ads or Internet permissions. I look forward to your feedback or contributions.
